# Signal K Log Viewer

The motivation for this simple log viewer is that Sever -> Server Log is often cluttered and not searchable. Especially on devices like the Victron Cerbo GX it can quickly become a challenge. 

## Requirements
- SignalK 2.15 or higher
- Systemd logging

## Features
- Get up to 10000 last lines from log, 2000 lines by default
- Filter log 

## Roadmap
- Copy to clipboard
- Support Victron GX
- Add Logo for Webapp
